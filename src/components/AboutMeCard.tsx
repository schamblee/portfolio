          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-3 font-normal text-base text-gray-700 dark:text-white px-4">
          I'm a senior full-stack engineer with over seven years of experience building secure,
          scalable web applications that are genuinely useful. I care a lot about clean
          architecture, accessibility, and reducing friction through thoughtful collaboration and
          problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p className="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-white px-4 pb-2">
          Outside of work, I'm a new dog parent to Daisy (see <span className='hidden sm:inline'>left</span><span className='sm:hidden'>above</span>), a sweet pitbull mix who I've
          been spending most of my time with lately. I'm also into board games, video games,
          puzzles, and other nerdy stuff üòÅ.
        </p>
        <p className="font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-white px-4 pb-2">
          I‚Äôm currently looking for my next opportunity as a senior engineer where I can continue to
          grow while helping a team ship high-quality, well-crafted software.
